In 1970s and 1980s Unix was the most advanced operating system and was going to be the standand OS in engineering and scientific computing. Unfortunely it was very expensive for students. GNU Project was launched in 1983 by Richard Stallman originally to develop a Unix-compatible operating system called GNU, intended to be entirely free software. Many programs and utilities were contributed by developers around the world, and by 1991 most of the components of the system were ready. Still missing was the kernel - the core of an operating system that handles memory allocation, controlls communicating with hardware devices and makes sure everything keeps running. Annoyed by cost of Unix, Linus Torvalds - student of computer science in Helsinki - set out to write this kernel. When he had written a basic kernel, he released the source code on the Internet. Source code is what you need to generate a program. With the source code it is possible to modify the program, fix bugs in it and add new features. Programmers started to use the free alternative that was Linux. There was some bugs but source code was open so many of programmers fixed the bugs that were annoyed for him and sent the code to Linus, who rolled it into kernel. Based on this mechanism Linux began to grow. An OS kernel on its own isn't a lot of use, but Linux is similar to Unix so there is a lot of software ready to compile on Linux. By about 1992 the first distributions appeared. A distribution is the term for a complete OS with utilities and applications you need to use computer in the way you want, for example there is almost always command interpreter, text editor, file explorer, graphical user interface, device manager and many other built-in programs. As more and more people got to know about Linux, some of them began to port the Linux kernel to most types of devices. Nowadays almost everyone is using Linux because Android is based on it.
