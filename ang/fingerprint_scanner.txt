There is a high trend in smartphones to eliminate everything except the screen from the front of phone.
There are several problems associated with this and one of them is the location of popular fingerprint scanners.
One of the best places for it is the bottom of the front of the phone.
Actual scanners need to have a direct contact with finger, so they need a dedicated place, which we don't have.
Here are two new technologies, mainly developed by vivo and synaptics to solve this problem.
Both of them enable smartphones producers to place the scanner below the screen.
So how it works?
Technology developed by synaptics uses an optical sensor.
The screen digitizer detects the finger, the OLED display lights up the finger, the sensor scans the highlighted finger, 
and the “matcher” verifies the image and confirms the imprint is yours, granting you access to phone.
As I said it needs not very popular OLED display. 
Its the main bad side of this technology. 
One of the reasons of this is that only OLED displays have the ability to light only a part of itself.
Another technology developed by vivo uses ultrasonic sensor.
It works by emitting ultrasonic sound waves which penetrate the skin of your finger and capture a 3D image of your fingerprint.
The problem with this technology is the range in which it works precisely and speed of scanning, but its getting better and better and the latest presented prototype works fine.
