We used to complain about many things in our surrounding, especially that one not controlled by us. Highly effective people make the decision to improve their lives through the things that they can influence rather than by simply reacting to external forces. This habit is called "be proactive". The second habit is "begin with the end in mind". It teaches that, in everything we do, we should start with a clear destination. We should know what we really want to do in life. That way, we can make sure the steps weâ€™re taking are in the right direction. Third habit is connected to the previous one. We know our goals and what direction we should choose but to be effective we have to prioritize tasks on our road. This habit is called "put first things first". If you are a specialist in some area and there is another specialist in the same area you are not enemies to each other. If you share your contacts, your knowledge to the second person you will both become better specialists and earn more money. Fighting with others won't help anyone, you won't gain any new knowledge. For you to win, another person does not have to lose. That habit is called "think win-win". The next habit is "seek first to understand, then to be understood". Humans tend to associate in social groups and form cooperative societies. To be effective in environment like that we have to interact effectively with other people. To achieve that we must seek to deeply understand them and their perspective through empathic listening. The sixth habit is "synergyze". "Two heads are better than one". Through mutual trust and understanding, one can often solve conflicts and find a better solution than the one that would be obtained through either person's individual effort. To be effective, we must devote the time to renewing ourselves physically, spiritually, mentally, and socially. Take time out from production to build production capacity. The name of this very last habit is "sharpen the saw".
